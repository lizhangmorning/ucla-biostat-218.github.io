# Syllabus -- Biostat 218 -- Observational Health Data Science and Informatics

## A. Overview

### Course Description
An introduction to observational research in the health data sciences. Topics include disease cohort characterization, patient-level prediction and population-level estimation using administrative claims and electronic health records.  Lectures will cover an introduction of observational health databases, a common data model for representing patient trajectories through healthcare systems, tools to manipulate data while preserving patient privacy, theory of patient-level prediction and casual inference from observational data, and best practices for generating reproducible and reliable observational studies.  Introductory theory will demonstrate how linear and generalized linear modeling is used in observational studies.
