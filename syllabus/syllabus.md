# Syllabus -- Biostat 218 -- Observational Health Data Science and Informatics

## A. Overview

### Course Description
An introduction to observational research in the health data sciences. Topics include disease cohort characterization, patient-level prediction and population-level estimation using administrative claims and electronic health records.  Lectures will cover an introduction of observational health databases, a common data model for representing patient trajectories through healthcare systems, tools to manipulate data while preserving patient privacy, theory of patient-level prediction and casual inference from observational data, and best practices for generating reproducible and reliable observational studies.  Introductory theory will demonstrate how linear and generalized linear modeling is used in observational studies.

### Inclusivity

UCLAâ€™s Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion provides resources, events, and information about current initiatives at UCLA to support equality for all members of the UCLA community. I hope that you will communicate with me or your TA if you experience anything in this course that does not support an inclusive environment, and you can also report any incidents you may witness or experience on campus to the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion on their website <https://equity.ucla.edu>.

## Course Assignments & Exams

### Homework Assignments

Homework assignments will generally come from the exercises provided in _The Book of OHDSI_.  Each homework will include an exercise in analyzing a real public health-related problem.  Assignments will be posted on Monday and due approximately two weeks after assignment by 5PM via email (PDF).

### Data Analysis Project

Students are expected to perform an original observational health data science analysis project during this course and present their theoretical or empirical findings in a mini-seminar series (approximately 15-20 mins per student) during Finals week.
Additionally, a written report of your work (max. 10 typed pages) is due on
[add date] by 5PM via email (PDF).  Students are responsible for finding an appropriate health domain and designing their study. One page project proposals are due
[add date] by 5PM via email (PDF).  Students should plan on attending several Biostatistics (Wednesdays at 3:30PM) and Bioinformatics (Mondays at 11:00AM) department seminars to get a feeling for the appropriate format.

### Grading

Grades will be based on the homework (40%), participation (10%) and final observational health analysis project (50%).
