## Advanced SQL

1. What is the minimum, maximum, and mean length (in days) of observation from the `synthetic` dataset? (Hint: you can use the `DATEDIFF` function to compute the time between two dates.)

2. How many people have at least one prescription of celecoxib from the `synthetic` dataset? (Note: thereâ€™s an easy way to do this, using `DRUG_ERA`, and a harder way using `DRUG_EXPOSURE` and `CONCEPT_ANCESTOR`. Can you do both?)

3. During which period in time (calender start and end date) did people start a celecoxib prescription from the `synthetic` dataset?

## Programmatic cohorts

X. First create a cohort definition using `Capr` for hypertensive patients.  Define hypertension as
- an occurrence of "Essential hypertension" (320128) and any of its descendants,
- a systolic blood pressure (3004249) >= 130 mmHg (8876), or
- a diastolic blood pressure (3012888) >= 80 mmHg
Patients enter the cohort at the first of any of these events, and remain in the cohort until their end of observation.

Then translate this cohort into SQL for the `duckdb` RDMS using `CohortGenerator`.  Provide a print-out of the SQL.

Finally, how many patients enter this cohort in our `synthetic` database?
